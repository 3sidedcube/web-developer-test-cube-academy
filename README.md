# 3SC Web Developer Test - Cube Academy

## Task

Build a simple web UI that interfaces with the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co).

This task is designed to assess how you will go about building a web application, at the very least you must demonstrate your ability to write:
* Readable and well laid out code
* JS / HTML and CSS
* Appropriate documentation (How would another developer get started your code?)


## Feature list

* Allow the user to view a list of pokemon (extra points for using pagination).
* Allow the user to search that list of pokemon by the pokemon's name.
* Allow the user to view a pokemon's details and statistics.
* Compare two pokemon's statistics together, side-by-side.
* Allow the user to maintain a list of their favourite Pokemon (extra points for data persistence (e.g. local storage)).
* Should run on modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera etc).

## Getting Started

* The following endpoint provides a list of Pokemon: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/
* You may use any other endpoints and resources provided by the Pokeapi to achieve the feature list.
* Your solution should demonstrate use of version control (git).
* You may use any additional JavaScript or CSS frameworks and libraries to achieve your solution.

## Submission

* The Submission must have version control history (.git directory) - this is essential so we can see how you went about implementing your solution.
* Can be zipped up and sent to us via email or hosted on GitHub.
* Please ensure that with your solution you include the following documentation (this can be included as part of a `README.md` or separate document)
  * A brief "Getting Started guide" on how to open the project locally
  * If you used any frameworks (JS or CSS) why did you choose them?
  * Did you have any challenges and if so, how did you overcome them?
  * Did you add any extra features?
  * If you had more time, what else would you implement?
